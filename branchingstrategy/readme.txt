this directory will have checkins etc., for branching strategy.

I will locally create a private branchingstrategy_featurebr
i will work on master branch locally
add some changes, 
i will switch to feature branch locally 
make changes 
then merge back feature branch into master locally.
is there a way to lock down changes to master that it cannot be directly pushed to but needs to happen via pull requests ?

i will create a dev2feature branch remote and add a bunch or changes.
Make a pull request and see if i can deal with that
