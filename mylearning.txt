I forked commitmas 30 day challenge on github
used source tree to connect clone my commitmas fork into my local repo
modified one file - first commit on master branch, 
looked at change in history- all local branch heads point to my change
locally there are 3 branches- one master, and one origin/master and one origin/head

checked if my commit was pushed to github

it was 

pushed my change up to remote ?
