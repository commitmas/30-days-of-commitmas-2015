## Overview

Tis the holiday season again, where we relax at home, eat loads of good food and spin driedels. This year, **let's keep learning** all the great stuff learned during the [vBrownBag DevOps sessions](http://professionalvmware.com/vbrownbag-devops-series/).

*Note:* Have an idea for Commitmas? Pull Requests are welcome!

Commit to Your Skill Level
==========================
We all have different level of expertise when it comes to GitHub. 


##Beginner
<a name="beginner"></a>
*You're a beginner if:* You're new enough to git that just the act of using it daily will be a lot of learning.

**Setup**:
* Create a GitHub account
* [Setup Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/)
* Initialize your own new repository with a README
* Clone your repository to your local development system

**Your challenge**:
* Update the README.md file **every day** with something you learned that day
* Add a meaningful comment to your commit. [Learn the right way to comment your commits.](https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap/wiki/Git-Commit-Message-Format)
* Push that commit to your GitHub repository
* Create additional repositories for scripts that you've created to do your job
* Learn how to use [`git commit --amend`](http://rnelson0.com/2014/12/26/using-git-amend-for-quick-corrections).
* [Keep your fork in sync with the original repo](http://rnelson0.com/2014/12/27/updating-your-git-fork-from-the-original-repo/).

**Helpful hints**:
* Remember that the goal of this is to *learn how to use GitHub*, so focus on git, not other code you'd also like to learn
* Feel free to use the GitHub website, native apps or command line. [Watch this vBB](http://neckbeardinfluence.com/technical-quick-hacking-your-way-into-github/) on GitHub to help you along
* Markdown is awesomely powerful, so challenge yourself to use some of the more complex syntax. [You can learn it all here.](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)


##Intermediate
<a name="intermediate"></a>
*You're at an intermediate level if:* You're comfortable with the basics of using git, have lurked around on GitHub but never contributed to a project. 

**Setup**:
* Fork an interesting repository that you want to contribute to
* Clone your repository to your local development system
* Create a new branch to develop in

**Your challenge**:
* Update the repository's Master branch **every day** in some way
* On your new branch, work on a meaningful contribution to your fork of the repository
* Add meaningful comments to your commits when you commit on both branches
* Open a Pull Request on the original repository from your new branch by the end of the 12 days of Commitmas!
* Learn how to use [`git rebase`](http://rnelson0.com/2014/12/23/using-git-rebase-to-rewrite-history/).

**Helpful hints**:
* Remember, *documentation is code too (especially when using Markdown)!* Find a project you want to support by improving documentation. Fork it and then make make your contributions during this challenge.

##Expert
<a name="expert"></a>
*You're an expert if:* You've managed multiple contributor repositories before, have more than 5 pull request accepted, and want to join in Commitmas to really push yourself.

**Setup**:
* You've done this a few times.

**Your challenge**:
* Open a new Pull Request on open source repositories you use **every single day** for the 12 days of Commitmas!
* Write a blog post describing a task/skill that you feel is important for Beginner or Intermediate level users to raise their git-fu!

**Helpful hints**:
* You really don't need any, but if you complete this challenge, please tell me ([@mjbrender](http://twitter.com/mjbrender)) and I'll definitely buy you a beer.
